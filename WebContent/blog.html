                        challenged us to get to know someone we didn’t already know. I stood up to look around when a
                        gentle hand touched my shoulder. I turned around to find a wrinkled, little old lady beaming up
                        at me with a smile that lit up her entire being. She said, “Hi handsome. My name is Rose. I’m
                        eighty-seven years old. Can I give you a hug?”</span>

                        eighty-seven years old. Can I give you a hug?”. I laughed and enthusiastically responded, “Of
                        course you
                        may!” and she gave me a giant squeeze.“Why are you in college at such a young, innocent age?” I
                        asked.She jokingly replied, “I’m here to meet a rich husband, get married, and have a couple of
                        kids…” “No seriously,” I asked. I was curious what may have motivated her to be taking on this
                        challenge at her age.“I always dreamed of having a college education and now I’m getting one!”
                        she told me. After class we walked to the student union building and shared a chocolate
                        milkshake. We became instant friends. Every day for the next three months, we would leave class
                        together and talk nonstop. I was always mesmerized listening to this “time machine” as she
                        shared her wisdom and experience with me. Over the course of the year, Rose became a campus icon
                        and she easily made friends wherever she went. She loved to dress up and she reveled in the
                        attention bestowed upon her from the other students. She was living it up.At the end of the
                        semester we invited Rose to speak at our football banquet. I’ll never forget what she taught us.
                        She was introduced and stepped up to the podium.As she began to deliver her prepared speech, she
                        dropped her three by five cards on the floor. Frustrated and a little embarrassed she leaned
                        into the microphone and simply said, “I’m sorry I’m so jittery. I gave up beer for Lent and this
                        whiskey is killing me! I’ll never get my speech back in order so let me just tell you what I
                        know.” As we laughed she cleared her throat and began, “We do not stop playing because we are
                        old; we grow old because we stop playing. There are only four secrets to staying young, being
                        happy, and achieving success. You have to laugh and find humor every day. You’ve got to have a
                        dream. When you lose your dreams, you die. We have so many people walking around who are dead
                        and don’t even know it! There is a huge difference between growing older and growing up. If you
                        are nineteen years old and lie in bed for one full year and don’t do one productive thing, you
                        will turn twenty years old. If I am eighty-seven years old and stay in bed for a year and never
                        do anything I will turn eighty-eight.Anybody can grow older. That doesn’t take any talent or
                        ability. The idea is to grow up by always finding opportunity in change. Have no regrets.
                        The elderly usually don’t have regrets for what we did, but rather for things we did not do. The
                        only people who fear death are those with regrets.”</span></p>

                        Once you get past the beginner-level energy-saving stuff, a whole new world of
                        thrifty nerdery opens up. Here are some secrets to copping a load of money off your utilities
                        bills.<br><br>
                        For Beginners :<br>
                        1.Don an extra jumper.<br>
                        2.Insulate your loft.<br>
                        3.Have a shower, not a bath.<br>
                        4.Only boil as much water as you need in your kettle.<br>
                        5.Put off turning on your central heating for as long as you can.<br>
                        6.Turn the light off when you leave a room.<br>
                        7.Unplug all your devices at the wall, because standby mode costs money.<br><br>
                        Advanced Level :<br>
                        At this point, in the interests of disclosure, I should point out that my husband has been known
                        to stage interventions, because I can get carried away.<br>
                        He is happy for me to tack aluminium foil behind the radiators, to reflect heat back into the
                        room instead of into the walls.<br>
                        My entire family is appreciative of the hearty winter soups and stews I make in my trusty slow
                        cooker, which uses a third of the electricity of the oven.<br>
                        They don’t even mind when I play the game of ‘How Low Can You Go?’ with the thermostat (probably
                        because they don’t notice; I’m good at that game.)<br>
                        But my husband drew the line the other year when I wanted to stick bubble wrap on the windows,
                        for extra insulation.
                        <br><br>
                        What? You think that’s going too far?<br><br>
                        In my defence, it wasn’t all our windows: just a couple of the small, single-glazed ones on the
                        side of the house. We haven’t yet replaced them, since moving into this doer-upper – and up here
                        in the North West, it gets cold and draughty in the winter months.
